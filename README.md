## Description
Although I knew from the beginning that my timeline for this project would only be about a week and a half, I really wanted to challenge myself and see what I could create with what I've learned in 3 months of learning to code.
When I decided on creating an appointment booking platform, I don't think I quite realized how substantial of a challenge I was getting myself into.

It became apparent that there is a lot of functionality that an appointment booking platform needs to offer that was outside of my knowledge base's abilities to create, but I chose to push myself to figure it out instead of scaling down the idea to reduce the difficulty.
Within the week and a half of building Appt, I learned how to implement a session-based authentication/authorization flow, integrate a CSS framework with custom CSS, implement/create several middlewares, and learn a smidge of jQuery, all while applying newly learned concepts like utilizing back-end frameworks and databases.

The result is a fully functional MEN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, Node.js) stack appointment booking app focused on simplifying the appointment booking and scheduling process for small businesses/service providers.
There are still a few minor kinks I'd like to work out to make it a more polished final product, but I'm happy with what I was able to accomplish within the timeframe that I had.

As always, I appreciate any feedback for potential improvements/fixes.
